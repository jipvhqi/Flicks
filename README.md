Time spent: **60** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following functionality is completed:

* User can view a list of movies (title, poster image, and overview) currently playing in theaters from the Movie Database API.
* Layout is optimized with the [ViewHolder](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Using-an-ArrayAdapter-with-ListView#improving-performance-with-the-viewholder-pattern) pattern.
* For each movie displayed, user can see the following details:
  * Title, Poster Image, Overview (Portrait mode)
  * Title, Backdrop Image, Overview (Landscape mode)
* Display a nice default [placeholder graphic](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Displaying-Images-with-the-Picasso-Library#configuring-picasso) for each image during loading.
* Improve the user interface through styling and coloring
* When viewing a popular movie (i.e. a movie voted for more than 5 stars) the video should show the full backdrop image as the layout.  Uses [Heterogenous ListViews](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Implementing-a-Heterogenous-ListView) or [Heterogenous RecyclerView](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Heterogenous-Layouts-inside-RecyclerView) to show different layouts.
* Allow user to view details of the movie including ratings and popularity within a separate activity or dialog fragment.
* Allow video trailers to be played in full-screen using the YouTubePlayerView.
    * Overlay a play icon for videos that can be played.
    * More popular movies should start a separate activity that plays the video immediately.
    * Less popular videos rely on the detail page should show ratings and a YouTube preview.
* Apply the popular [Butterknife annotation library](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Reducing-View-Boilerplate-with-Butterknife) to reduce boilerplate code.
* Apply rounded corners for the poster or background images using [Glide transformations](https://github.com/wasabeef/glide-transformations)
* Replaced android-async-http network client with the popular [OkHttp](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Using-OkHttp) networking libraries.
* Use theÂ [RecyclerView](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Using-the-RecyclerView) to display results
* Use Parcelable instead of Serializable using the popular [Parceler library](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Using-Parceler).
* Leverages the popular [GSON library](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Using-Android-Async-Http-Client#decoding-with-gson-library) to streamline the parsing of JSON data.
* Leverages the [Retrofit networking library](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Consuming-APIs-with-Retrofit) to access the Movie Database API.
